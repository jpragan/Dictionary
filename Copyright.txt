*Therefore, you should probably have about 60 meg to load them.*

**The HTML version is one large 45M file, which is 15M zipped.**
This HTML version is a first draft for my search engine version:
http://humanities.uchicago.edu/forms_unrest/webster.form.html
and Caveat emptor!!

You will find MANY errors in both versions.  We would LOVE your
suggestions, corrections, emendations, and new words.  help.out
is the file you should refer to if you are interested.


Preliminary Version 0.4 so named at the request of the provider;
this is going to need some serious proofreading, as much of this
material was typed in by hand by non-native speakers of English.

Our thanks to Patrick Cassidy for organizing and financing these
efforts on behalf of Project Gutenberg.  Please read his note in
file "*.*"

This is a LARGE dictionary, the first edition of perhaps what is
the most famous dictionary in the world and our communication on
the matter of copyright with the publisher has resolved that the
publisher has no copyright interest in this material in the U.S.
but please check your own country, as below, also, please, watch
for changes in both the U.S. Copyright Law AND other country's--
there ARE movements in the U.S. to eliminate this information as
part of the Public Domain, which, if successful, might require a
revision or retraction of these files.



Please take a look at the important information in this header.
We encourage you to keep this file on your own disk, keeping an
electronic path open for the next readers.  Do not remove this.

The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.  To be sure you have an
up to date first edition [xxxxx10x.xxx] please check file sizes
in the first week of the next month.  Since our ftp program has
a bug in it that scrambles the date [tried to fix and failed] a
look at the file size will have to do, but we will try to see a
new copy has at least one byte more or less.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar, then we produce 2
million dollars per hour this year we, will have to do four text
files per month:  thus upping our productivity from one million.
The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is 10% of the expected number of computer users by the end
of the year 2001.
